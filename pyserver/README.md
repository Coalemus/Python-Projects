# Python Server

Source: <https://defn.io/tags/web-app-from-scratch/>

## Progress

Stuck on having only functional code from part 1.

Functional Code tested on the `simpleserver.ipynb` file.

- Available types of servers include:
  - Simple HTTP request/response server
  - Simple HTTP request/response server without bad responses
  - Simple HTTP request/response server with logs
  - Simple HTTP request/response File server where it fetches the ./www/index.html file

TODO document the process to dissect and learn about the structure.

## Modifications from tutorial code

None so far.
